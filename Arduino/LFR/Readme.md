# Line Follower Robot Code Analysis Report
## 1. Introduction

This report analyzes the code for a line follower robot (LFR) project, aiming to improve its performance in competition settings. The code provided focuses on basic sensor reading and motor control logic.

## 2. Code Analysis
```
C++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
  pinMode(3, INPUT);
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  int ls = digitalRead(2); // Read left sensor
  int rs = digitalRead(3); // Read right sensor

  // Control motor based on sensor readings
  if (ls == LOW && rs == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(8, LOW);  // Stop both motors
    digitalWrite(9, LOW);
    digitalWrite(10, LOW);
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  } else if (ls == LOW && rs == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(8, HIGH); // Turn right (activate left motor)
    digitalWrite(9, LOW);
    digitalWrite(10, LOW);
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  } else if (ls == HIGH && rs == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(8, LOW);  // Turn left (activate right motor)
    digitalWrite(9, LOW);
    digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(8, HIGH); // Move forward (activate both motors)
    digitalWrite(9, LOW);
    digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  }
}
```
Use code with caution.

### Comments:

- The code defines two sensor pins (2 and 3) as inputs and four motor control pins (8, 9, 10, and 11) as outputs.
- The loop() function continuously reads the sensor values and controls the motors based on a simple logic:
- Both sensors off line: Stop motors.
- Left sensor on line: Turn right.
- Right sensor on line: Turn left.
- Both sensors on line: Move forward.
## 3. Potential Issues and Improvements

Limited control: The current approach lacks proportional control, leading to jerky movements and overshooting the line.
Fixed speed: Motors always run at full speed, causing instability and overshoot.
Limited sensor information: Two sensors might not be enough for complex tracks or sharp curves.
## 4. Recommendations

Implement proportional control: Adjust motor speeds based on sensor distance from the line (turn sharper when farther off).
Introduce speed control: Vary motor speeds for smoother movements and better line following.
Consider additional sensors: Use more sensors to detect curves or obstacles.
Handle edge cases: Implement logic for scenarios like both sensors detecting a line or losing line detection.
Thorough testing and calibration: Test the robot on various courses and fine-tune the code for optimal performance.
## 5. Conclusion

The provided code offers a basic foundation for an LFR. However, incorporating the suggested improvements, such as proportional control, speed variation, and additional sensors, can significantly enhance its performance and competitiveness. Remember to adapt the code and hardware setup based on your specific motor driver, sensors, and competition requirements.
